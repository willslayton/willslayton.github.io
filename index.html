				<p>Over the past few years I've worked on many projects so here's a list of some that stand out. Many of them live on <a href="https://github.com/willslayton">my GitHub</a> if you would like to go there to browse instead.</p>
				<!-- Creating the unordered list of peojects -->

					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/willslayton/willslayton.github.io" style="font-size: 14pt;">This website!</a><br>
						<p>Made completely from scratch using only HTML/CSS and a little JS. It was created specifically to host my e-portfolio and see if I can still remember how to create a website after all of these years.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/willslayton/Simple-YouTube-Downloader" style="font-size: 14pt;">Simple YouTube Downloader</a><br>
						<p>A simple script to download YouTube video and audio streams of a certain quality using <a href="https://github.com/nficano/pytube">pytube</a> and combining them in an mp4 container using <a href="https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python">ffmpeg</a> for Python3.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/willslayton/TopTextBottomText" style="font-size: 14pt;">"Top Text, Bottom Text" Image Maker</a><br>
						<p>A test of Python3 image processing using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/2.2.1/">Pillow</a> that I created based on the style of many old internet memes for a given input image and text. It tries to account for dimensions of the image when determining the font size and where to center the text.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/willslayton/DiscordBot" style="font-size: 14pt;">Simple Discord Bot</a><br>
						<p>An IRC bot implementation for the IM service <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py">discord.py wrapper</a> in Python3. I wrote a few example commands that show the variety and flexibility of functions that can created using this setup.</p>

				<h2>AITR challenges</h2>
				<br>
				<p>During my time in the <a href="http://www.creekaitr.com/">Academy of Information Technology and Robotics (AITR)</a> there were many projects woven into the curriculum involving all sorts of STEM topics like cybersecurity, robotics, and programming. Most of these "challenges" lasted for six weeks, but some were so involved that twelve weeks was required. Below is a list of some of the most interesting challenges that my peers and I worked on back in high school.</p>
				<!-- Creating the unordered list of peojects -->
				<ul>
					<!-- Each element in the list contains title of the challenge and a short description -->
					<li>
						<h3>Cybersecurity CTF</h3><br>
						<p>To teach our class about cybersecurity the academy teachers arranged a six week challenge which culminated in a CTF (capture the flag) competition between student teams. In a CTF each team is given an image on a virtual machine that has several security flaws or vulnerabilities (known as flags) that the team is tasked with finding and fixing. AITR has close ties to our school's <a href="https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/">CyberPatriot</a> team, which competes in state and national CTFs, so we were visited by guest speakers from the team to teach us the basics of computer security.</p>
