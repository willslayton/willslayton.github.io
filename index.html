				<h2>AITR challenges</h2>
				<br>
				<p>During my time in the Academy of Information Technology and Robotics (AITR) there were many projects woven into the curriculum involving all sorts of STEM topics like cybersecurity, robotics, and programming. Most of these "challenges" lasted for six weeks, but some were so involved that twelve weeks was required. Below is a list of some of the most interesting challenges that my peers and I worked on back in high school.</p>
